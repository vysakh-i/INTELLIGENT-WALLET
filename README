Intelligent wallet is a device which keeps  track of one’s bank account details and  displays the same. For this, the device is equipped with an LCD display module. The component of the device is an Arduino Fio micro controller. The required data is accessed from the  user’s bank account webpage via the  mobile phone of the user. There is a python program running in the python interpreter in the phone which extracts the required data from the webpage and transmits it to the micro controller via Bluetooth connectivity.
The Bluetooth receiver mounted on the device receives this data and displays it on the screen. There is also a provision for notifying the user in case of an update or interruption in the connectivity using a beeper. The micro controller is programmed in embedded C for performing all the above tasks
